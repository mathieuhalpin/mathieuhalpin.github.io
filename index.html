                    <p>
                        My name is Mathieu Halpin and I am a senior at the University of Colorado at Boulder, where I am studying Anthropology and minoring in the Creative Technology and Design program. I am on track to receive my BA in Anthropology in the coming months.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am interested in researching cultural criticism and mass media, and defining a creative practice with physical computing being my medium. In my research, I want to explore the ways that mass media influences our culture and the role that technology plays in shaping our understanding of the world. I am particularly interested in exploring the ways that physical computing can be used to create new forms of expression and communication.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In my art, I strive to combine my passion for technology with my interest in cultural criticism to create thought-provoking and engaging works that challenge the viewer to think differently about the world around them. Whether I am using hardware, software, or a combination of both, my goal is to create art that inspires, educates, and entertains.

                            One of my main interests is physical computing for art, which involves using technology to create interactive, physical systems that can sense and respond to the world around them. I find this field particularly fascinating because it allows artists to explore the intersection of technology and the physical world, and create new forms of expression that can engage and inspire audiences.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Another area of interest for me is cultural criticism, which involves analyzing and evaluating the various cultural phenomena that shape our society. I find this field to be particularly relevant in today's world, where technology is increasingly shaping the way we think, act, and interact with each other.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I am also interested in online communities, and how they are changing the way we communicate, share information, and connect with others. I enjoy participating in online communities and learning about the unique cultures, norms, and values that emerge within these spaces.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I am inspired by the work of Jean Baudrillard and Mark Fisher, who were both cultural critics who explored the impact of technology on our culture and society. Baudrillard's concept of the "hyperreal" and Fisher's notion of "hauntology" have been particularly influential for me, as they provide a framework for understanding the ways in which technology can both enhance and distort our experiences of the world around us. These ideas connect with my interests in physical computing for art, cultural criticism, and online communities, as they offer a way to think about the complex relationship between technology, culture, and the self.
