            <p>
              My name is Mathieu Halpin and I am a senior at the University of
              Colorado at Boulder, where I am studying Anthropology and minoring
              in the Creative Technology and Design program. I am on track to
              receive my BA in Anthropology in the coming months.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am interested in researching cultural criticism and mass media,
              and defining a creative practice with physical computing being my
              medium. In my research, I want to explore the ways that mass media
              influences our culture and the role that technology plays in
              shaping our understanding of the world. I am particularly
              interested in exploring the ways that physical computing can be
              used to create new forms of expression and communication.
            </p>
            <p>
              In my art, I strive to combine my passion for technology with my
              interest in cultural criticism to create thought-provoking and
              engaging works that challenge the viewer to think differently
              about the world around them. Whether I am using hardware,
              software, or a combination of both, my goal is to create art that
              inspires, educates, and entertains.

            <section class="interests">
              <p>
                One of my main interests is physical computing for art, which
                involves using technology to create interactive, physical
                systems that can sense and respond to the world around them. I
                find this field particularly fascinating because it allows
                artists to explore the intersection of technology and the
                physical world, and create new forms of expression that can
                engage and inspire audiences.
              </p>
              <p>
                Another area of interest for me is cultural criticism, which
                involves analyzing and evaluating the various cultural phenomena
                that shape our society. I find this field to be particularly
                relevant in today's world, where technology is increasingly
                shaping the way we think, act, and interact with each other.
              </p>
              <p>
                I am also interested in online communities, and how they are
                changing the way we communicate, share information, and connect
                with others. I enjoy participating in online communities and
                learning about the unique cultures, norms, and values that
                emerge within these spaces.
              </p>
              <p>
                I am inspired by the work of Jean Baudrillard and Mark Fisher,
                who were both cultural critics who explored the impact of
                technology on our culture and society. Baudrillard's concept of
                the "hyperreal" and Fisher's notion of "hauntology" have been
                particularly influential for me, as they provide a framework for
                understanding the ways in which technology can both enhance and
                distort our experiences of the world around us. These ideas
                connect with my interests in physical computing for art,
                cultural criticism, and online communities, as they offer a way
                to think about the complex relationship between technology,
                culture, and the self.
